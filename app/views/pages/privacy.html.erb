  <h1>PRIVACY POLICY üçã</h1>

  <p>Welcome to our little corner of the internet, where pixels meet privacy! At LEMONZ, we take privacy seriously, but we promise not to be as serious as your grandma‚Äôs secret cookie recipe.</p>

  <h2>What We Collect</h2>
  <p>Like a ninja collects shurikens, we stealthily collect only the essential information needed to make your experience smoother than a freshly buttered slide.</p>

  <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <p>Your data is our VIP guest ‚Äì we treat it like royalty! We use it to personalize your experience, not to write a best-selling novel about your life. Your secrets are safe with us!</p>

  <h2>Cookies (Not the Chocolate Chip Kind)</h2>
  <p>We use cookies, but sorry, they won‚Äôt satisfy your sweet tooth. They just help us understand your digital cravings, making our site as delightful as a surprise puppy video.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Shenanigans</h2>
  <p>Sometimes, we share the love with trusted partners. Rest assured, they‚Äôre like family we actually like. No third-party drama here!</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>Our digital fortress is more secure than a double-locked diary. We've hired the best internet bouncers to keep your data safe and sound.</p>

  <h2>Updates & Hugs</h2>
  <p>Just like your favorite app, we update our policies. No worries, we won't spam your inbox; we just want to keep you in the loop.</p>

  <p>By using LEMONZ, you're not just a user ‚Äì you're part of our digital family. So, grab a virtual cookie, kick back, and enjoy your stay!</p>
